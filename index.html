                  <p>― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.
                    Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                    fault.</p>

                    other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                    and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                    million to settle that...</p>

                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a

                    million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
